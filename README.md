# Research-Project

This project aims to develop a neural network model to predict the refractivity profile of radar waves based on sea clutter returns. By leveraging deep learning, the goal is to improve the accuracy and reliability of radar systems by modeling how radar waves interact with atmospheric conditions, enabling better real-time performance analysis.

I have created two codes because I was originally informed that I would be given inputs of incidence angle and propagation factor, however upon discussion, we thought the best input to get would be the sea 'clutter' returns. Both codes and analysis of the codes are in links below.

[Second code with input of sea 'clutter' returns](./Codes/Input%20of%20Sea%20Clutter%20Returns/)

## Challenges
* Adapting the models to handle noisy or incomplete real-world data.
* Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
* Handling the complexity of atmospheric effects in real radar data.

## Next Steps
* Integrate real-world radar data when available.
* Fine-tune models based on the new data.
* Conduct further validation to improve model robustness and reliability.
* Explore the use of other machine learning models and techniques to enhance predictions.
