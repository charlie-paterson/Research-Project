# Research-Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the refractive index of radar waves based on the input parameters of wave propagation and incidence angle. Using various machine learning models (such as Support Vector Machines and Fine Tree models), the goal is to improve the reliability and accuracy of radar systems by better understanding and predicting how radar waves interact with atmospheric conditions.
